# Single Cycle 32-bit ARM Microprocessor

## Project Overview
Design and implementation of a Single Cycle 32-bit ARM Microprocessor that supports the following instructions:

- **LDR** (Load Register)
- **STR** (Store Register)
- **ADD** (Addition)
- **SUB** (Subtraction)
- **ORR** (Logical OR)
- **AND** (Logical AND)
- **B** (Branch)

## Implementation
- The microprocessor is written in Verilog.
- Currently Supports LDR, STR.
