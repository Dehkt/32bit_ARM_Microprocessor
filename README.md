# Single Cycle 32-bit ARM Microprocessor Design

## Project Overview
Design and implementation of a Single Cycle 32-bit ARM Microprocessor that supports the following instructions:

- **LDR** (Load Register)
- **STR** (Store Register)
- **ADD** (Addition)
- **SUB** (Subtraction)
- **ORR** (Logical OR)
- **AND** (Logical AND)
- **B** (Branch)

## Implementation
- The microprocessor is written using SystemVerilog.
- Currently only supports the **LDR** instruction.

## Future Work
- Extend support to additional instructions (STR, ADD, SUB, ORR, AND, B).
